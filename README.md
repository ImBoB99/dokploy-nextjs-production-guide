# dokploy-nextjs-production-guide
A guide on how to set up Github Actions workflow to automatically build an image of your Next.js app and push it to Docker Hub, which we then use in Dokploy to deploy the remote built image without having to spend server resources to build it ourselves. It cuts down on deployment time and conserves your VPS resources.
